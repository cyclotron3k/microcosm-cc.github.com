              <h2>The Microcosm API</h2>

              <p>The Microcosm API is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#RESTful_web_APIs">RESTful</a> API. We acknowledge that the users of an API are the developers who implement against the API, and with that in mind we've sought to make pragmatic choices that help and assist you the developer. With that in mind we offer an API that we believe has the best of REST without limiting the ways in which you, the developer, might implement a solution using our API.</p>
              <p>What we give you:
                <ul>
                  <li>A <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> interface of resources via the most common HTTP verbs.</li>
                  <li>Token-based authentication to identify the user and client accessing the API.</li>
                  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">HATEOAS</a> meta data to show the relation of a given resource to other resources, as well as a description of your user's permissions so that you know what state changing actions your user can perform.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>Deviations from pure REST:
                <ul>
                  <li>We allow HTTP methods to be overridden.</li>
                  <li>We include support for callbacks (including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">JSONP</a>), which means that our responses include meta data in addition to the resource itself.</li>
                  <li>We haven't created unique content types for each resource, we just use <code>application/json</code> everywhere.</li>
                  <li>We put our API version in the URL rather than within HTTP headers.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>The best way to get to know an API is to use it, so let's begin...</p>

              <h2>Boiler Plate</h2>

              <p>Our responses are wrapped in boiler plate JSON that helps to describe what has happened. The purpose of this is to support callbacks, provide a really simple way of getting error/success information, and to additionally support JSONP.</p>
              <p>All responses are wrapped in this:</p>
              <pre><code>{
  "context": "",
  "status": 200,
  "data": null
  "error": null
}</code></pre>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li><code>context</code> = A string value given to the API via the querystring <code>?context=foo</code> would be returned to you here. This enables you to make asynchronous callbacks and to identify which request this response relates to.</li>
                  <li><code>status</code> = The integer HTTP status of the response. You should use the HTTP header status, this is provided to help JSONP requests.</li>
                  <li><code>data</code> = The actual JSON representation of the resource requested.</li>
                  <li><code>error</code> = An array of strings that contain any error messages. If error is null, then no error has occurred.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>The boiler plate can be disabled by ensuring <code>disableBoiler</code> is set in the querystring like this: <code>/api/version/resource?disableBoiler</code>. With that set, only the data object would be returned in the body of the response.</p>

              <h2>Callbacks using JSONP</h2>

              <p>We support JSONP, and to achieve that 3 things are needed:
                <ol>
                  <li>The ability to wrap the returned JSON in a callback function.</li>
                  <li>The ability to override the HTTP method so that you can perform the action of HTTP PUT and HTTP DELETE via HTTP POST.</li>
                  <li>The ability to only ever return a HTTP 200 OK status.</li>
                </ol>
              </p>
              <p>To fulfil the first requirement you can wrap the response in a callback function name you provide by adding <code>callback=funcName</code> to the querystring of your request.</p>
              <p>To fulfil the second requirement you can overload the HTTP method by making a HTTP POST request and adding <code>method=PUT</code> or <code>method=DELETE</code> as necessary to the querystring.</p>
              <p class="well well-small">Note: If you are not using JSONP or have not proven that you require HTTP method overriding, then please do not do this. Instead just use the correct HTTP verb when you make your request. HTTP PUT and DELETE are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Idempotent_methods_and_web_applications">idempotent</a> whereas HTTP POST is not, and this can create issues.</p>
              <p>To fulfil the third requirement you may add <code>always200</code> to the querystring and this will force the API to only ever return a HTTP 200 OK header regardless of what happened, however the <code>status</code> property in the boiler plate JSON will still give the underlying HTTP status code so that you can handle the response appropriately.</p>
              <p>This means that to make a JSONP request for GET and POST, you merely have made a request similar to <code>/api/version/resource?always200&amp;callback=funcName</code> and for PUT and DELETE you have additionally added <code>&amp;method=PUT</code> or <code>&amp;method=DELETE</code> as necessary to the querystring.</p>
              <p class="well well-small">Note: You should not combine <code>disableBoiler</code> with the JSONP features, as the API will only ever be returning HTTP 200 OK, and you will need to check the <code>status</code> property of the boiler plate.</p>
              <p>You are also able to provide <code>context</code> via the querystring and whatever the value of that parameter is will be provided back to you in the <code>context</code> property of the boiler plate.</p>

              <h2>URL Patterns</h2>

              <p>The base path of the API is <code>/api/v1</code>. All resources are children of that base path.</p>
              <p>There are two patterns of URLs, and which is used is determined by whether the resource name in the URL is pluralised or not. Resources that are pluralised represent collections <code>/api/v1/things</code>, and resources that are not pluralised represent a single resource <code>/api/v1/thing</code>.</p>
              <p>Single resources tend to be descriptive meta-data only and will usually only respond successfully to a GET request.</p>
              <p>Resource URLs never end in a trailing slash, as resources are themselves the entity you operate on, and a trailing slash would indicate a directory on the web server.</p>

              <h2>Pagination</h2>
              <p>Pagination of collections is supported using the offset approach:
                <ul>
                  <li><code>limit</code> = <code>/api/v1/things?limit=10</code> would return up to 10 'things'.</li>
                  <li><code>offset</code> = <code>/api/v1/things?offset=50</code> would return up to the default number of 'things' starting at the 50th record.</li>
                  <li><code>limit</code> with <code>offset</code> = <code>/api/v1/things?limit=10&amp;offset=30</code> would return up to 10 'things' starting at the 30th record.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>The default value for <code>limit</code> is 25, and the default value for <code>offset</code> is 0. Meaning that if you do nothing, then you will get up to 25 records at the beginning of the collection.</p>
              <p>The format of our collections is consistent, all resources that return a collection of items will do so using this structure:</p>

              <p>As a developer implementing against the API, you must rely on the <a href="#http">HTTP status codes</a> returned to handle errors.</p>
              <p>If an error has occurred we will additionally inform you, the developer, of the cause of the error by populating the <code>error</code> property of the <a href="boiler">boiler plate</a>. The <code>error</code> property holds an array of strings to help you, the developer, to fix the issue.</p>
              <p>Because the audience of the error text is you, the developer, you should take care not to send this message to the end user but instead handle it in some elegant way. The error text is not localised, will always be in English, and is designed to be understood by a developer and not an end user.</p>
              <p>An example error (in this case for an invalid authentication access token):</p>
              <pre><code>HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
